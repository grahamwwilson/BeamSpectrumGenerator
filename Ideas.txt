Consider changing the parametrization 
to replace pbody by parms?
or ppeak by parms?

There are a few really correlated parameters:
1.  96.7%: ppeak/alphaa
2. -95.6%: pbody/alphab

The alpha/beta correlation for body = +82.8%
The alpha/beta correlation for arms = +83.7%

We can now consider trying to fit 3 quantiles of z_PV.
This is likely to change parm1 relative to parm2.
