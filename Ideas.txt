o Consider changing the parametrization 
  to replace pbody by parms? or ppeak by parms?

o Correlations:
  There are a few really correlated parameters:
  1.  96.7%: ppeak/alphaa
  2. -95.6%: pbody/alphab
  The alpha/beta correlation for body = +82.8%
  The alpha/beta correlation for arms = +83.7%

o We can now consider trying to fit quantiles of z_PV.
  This is likely to change parm1 relative to parm2.

o Maybe also divide into small |zPV| and large |zPV|.

o Could aso reparametrize with alpha0, beta0 and 
  have dalpha and dbeta parameters.
  
  Would be easier to play with alternative parametrizations 
  and constraints. Could it also help to decorrelate some 
  parameters?
