ISSUE 1
-------

Some events end up with infinite weights likely caused by y1 = 1 within 
double precision accuracy. ie about 1e-16.
Frequency is 8 events per million for betaalt.f compared to betapars1.f.
Current solution is to set the weight to the pregion ratio and ignore the 
beta distribution difference.

Possible solutions.

1. May be better to save the actual value of dy1 where y1 = 1.0 - dy1 
   and evaluate the probability density more carefully.
   
2. Could it be that it is exacerbated by RM48 only having 48 bits precision?

3. Would it be better to use some remapping like used by Thorsten Ohl in CIRCE?

ISSUE 2
-------

Would be better to store the value of 1-x etc in the file so that we can see 
small values, and use scientific notation for the values.
